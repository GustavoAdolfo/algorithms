# Maximal Disjoint Intervals

This study is based on geeksforgeeks.org lessos and examples. For complete information see [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximal-disjoint-intervals/], just like the implementations examples for Java and C++.

Given a set of N intervals, the task is to find the maximal set of mutually disjoint intervals. Two intervals [i, j] & [k, l] are said to be disjoint if they do not have any point in common. Implementation of diverses algorithms in distincts programing languages
